# Neural Algorithmic Reasoning Experiments

This repository is a playground for experimenting with Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR).
Current focus:
- BFS execution using SALSA-CLRS.
- Generalization testing on random subgraphs of the ogbn-arxiv dataset.

## Structure

- `src/`: Source code for models and experiments.
  - `models/`: Implementations of NAR models (SALSA).
  - `experiments/`: Training and evaluation scripts.
  - `utils/`: Data loading and graph generation utilities.
- `data/`: Directory for datasets (ogbn-arxiv, etc.).
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for analysis and visualization.
