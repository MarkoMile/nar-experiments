# This script handles the training loop for the BFS task.
# It should include:
# - Argument parsing for hyperparameters (learning rate, batch size, etc.).
# - Initialization of the SALSA model defined in src/models/salsa.py.
# - Data generation loop (using src/utils/graph_generation.py) or loading.
# - The training loop: forward pass, loss calculation (against ground truth BFS), backward pass.
# - Logging of metrics (accuracy, loss).
# - Model checkpointing.
