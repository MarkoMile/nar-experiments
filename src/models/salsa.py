# This file defines the SALSA-CLRS model architecture.
# It should contain:
# - The SALSA model class definition, inheriting from a base GNN or CLRS processor.
# - Configuration for the specific algorithmic task (BFS).
# - Methods for the forward pass, message passing, and state updates.
# - Integration points with the CLRS-30 benchmark framework.
