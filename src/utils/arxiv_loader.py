# Utilities for handling the ogbn-arxiv dataset.
# It should include functions to:
# - Download and load the ogbn-arxiv dataset using OGB libraries.
# - Convert the citation graph into a format suitable for the model.
# - Implement subgraph sampling strategies (e.g., random walk sampling, node-induced subgraphs) to create smaller test instances for BFS.
