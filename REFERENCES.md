### SALSA-CLRS: A Sparse and Scalable Benchmark for Algorithmic Reasoning

- **Authors**: Julian Minder, Florian Grötschla, Joël Mathys, Roger Wattenhofer
- **Paper**: [arXiv:2309.12253](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12253) (Presented at LoG 2023)
- **GitHub**: [jkminder/SALSA-CLRS](https://github.com/jkminder/SALSA-CLRS)
- **Description**: An extension to the CLRS algorithmic learning benchmark, prioritizing scalability and the utilization of sparse representations. Includes adapted algorithms from the original CLRS benchmark and introduces new problems from distributed and randomized algorithms.

### The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark

- **Authors**: Petar Veličković, Adrià Puigdomènech Badia, David Budden, Razvan Pascanu, Andrea Banino, Misha Dashevskiy, Raia Hadsell, Charles Blundell, et al.
- **Paper**: [arXiv:2205.15659](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15659) (ICML 2022)
- **GitHub**: [deepmind/clrs](https://github.com/deepmind/clrs)
- **Description**: The CLRS Algorithmic Reasoning Benchmark, covering classical algorithms from the Introduction to Algorithms textbook. The benchmark spans a variety of algorithmic reasoning procedures, including sorting, searching, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, string algorithms and geometric algorithms.

### Neural Algorithmic Reasoning

- **Authors**: Petar Veličković, Charles Blundell
- **Paper**: [arXiv:2105.02761](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02761) (Published in Patterns)
- **DOI**: [10.1016/j.patter.2021.100273](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2021.100273)
- **Description**: Opinion paper on neural algorithmic reasoning - the art of building neural networks that are able to execute algorithmic computation. Discusses how algorithms possess fundamentally different qualities to deep learning methods and argues that better algorithmic mimicry would enable stronger generalization in deep learning.
